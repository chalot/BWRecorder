* of the QM modeling tool, but are the fastest and need the least run-time
* support (the smallest event-processor taking up the least code space).
*
* QMsm is also the base class for the QFsm and QHsm state machines, which
* can be coded and maintained by hand (as well as by QM), but aren't as fast
* and requrie significantly more run-time code (0.5-1KB) to execute.
*
* \note QMsm is not intended to be instantiated directly, but rather serves
* as the base structure for derivation of state machines in the application
* code.
*
* The following example illustrates how to derive a state machine structure
* from QMsm. Please note that the QMsm member 'super' is defined as the
* _first_ member of the derived struct.
