* NOTE01:
* QFsm inherits QMsm, so by the "inheritance of structures" convention
* it should call the constructor of the superclass, i.e., QMsm_ctor().
* However, this would pull in the QMsmVtbl, which in turn will pull in
* the code for QMsm_init() and QMsm_dispatch() implemetations. To avoid
* this code size penalty, in case QMsm is not used in a given project,
* the QFsm_ctor() performs direct intitialization of the Vtbl, which avoids
* pulling in the code for QMsm.
