/*****************************************************************************
* NOTE01:
* QMActive inherits QActive, so by the "inheritance of structures" convention
* it should call the constructor of the superclass, i.e., QActive_ctor().
* However, this would pull in the QActiveVtbl, which in turn will pull in
* the code for QHsm_init() and QHsm_dispatch() implemetations, which is
* expensive. To avoid this code size penalty, in case QHsm is not used in
* a given project, the QMActive_ctor() calls the QMsm_ctor(), which avoids
* pulling in the code for QHsm.
